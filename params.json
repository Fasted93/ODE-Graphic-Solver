{"name":"Ode - Graphic Solver","tagline":"A numerical solver and phase space grapher for ODE systems written in Java","body":"ODE - Graphic Solver\r\n==================\r\n\r\n###Description\r\n\r\nODE Graphic-Solver is a program written in Java using Processing used for getting a numerical solution and graphing the phase space of an ODE system.\r\n\r\n###What do I need to run it?\r\n\r\nYou simply need to install Processing (https://www.processing.org/), open ODE_GS.pde and click run.\r\n\r\n###How can I run it?\r\n\r\nGo to \"Releases\" and pick the last versionand download it and download your binaries.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can compile those versions and run it freely.\r\n\r\n###Status\r\n\r\nCurrently, the code is not useful since it only uses an Euler method for solving the system.\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n####What ODE-GS can do\r\n\r\n- You can write in the code a 2D ODE system and it will graph the solutions when you click on a point.\r\n- Uses the Euler's method for solving the system and set the speed and integration precission.\r\n- Zoom in and out with \"W\" and \"S\".\r\n- Input an ODE system\r\n\r\n####What ODE-GS can't do and probably will do\r\n\r\n- 2D camera.\r\n- RK4 and more integration methods.\r\n- Change the integration method.\r\n- 3D systems.\r\n- Let the user change the solving speed and acuracy.\r\n- Lot of things more...\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\ne-mail: martin.sp.93@gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
