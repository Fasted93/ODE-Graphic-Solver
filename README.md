ODE - Graphic Solver
==================

###Description

ODE Graphic-Solver is a program written in Java using Processing used for getting a numerical solution and graphing the phase space of an ODE system.

###How can I run it?

Go to "Releases" and pick the last version and download it and download your binaries.

You can compile the latest non-release versions and run it freely.

###Status

Currently, the code is not useful since it only uses an Euler method for solving the system.

##Features

####What ODE-GS can do

- You can write in the code a 2D ODE system and it will graph the solutions when you click on a point.
- Uses the Euler's method for solving the system and set the speed and integration precission.
- Zoom in and out with "W" and "S".
- Input an ODE system

####What ODE-GS can't do and probably will do

- 2D camera.
- RK4 and more integration methods.
- Change the integration method.
- 3D systems.
- Let the user change the solving speed and acuracy.
- Lot of things more...
